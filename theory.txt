## Polymorphism


## Method Overloading
1. All the methods should hae same name
2. All the methods should have smae cladd
3. but methods should have different parameters
            Same types of parameters
            Same numbers of paremeters
            Same sequences of parameters
4. There should be inheritance between classes

## Method hiding and overriding

Method hiding
1. A techique in which a user can re define the method of a base or parent class using the new keyword. This results in hiding the main basic inplementation provided by the base class o fthat particulat method. 
2. In method hiding, a base class reference variable pinting to a  child class objectm will invoke the hiding method of the base class


Method Overriding
1. Method overriding allows usto have virtual and abstract method in the base using derived classes with the same name and the same pareamenter
2.it is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
3. It enable we to provide specific implementation if the method in child class which is already provided by its base class

Override: A method with override keywoard in a child class means it is overriding a virtual method of parent class to pricide different implementaion
: The override keyword override sthe base clas smethod int he derived class
